[Kloudi](https://kloudi.tech/ 'Take control of your tools') helps developers **take control of their tools** by optimising workflows through horizontal layering of its platform across all their tools. It makes developer tools cross-functional, data from tools contextual & actionable and all the related workflows optimal. The VSCode extension ensures complete functionality of the platform is extended to the users in their IDE, bringing a zero navigation world to its users.

# Features

User signs-up and fills in the EAP form. The EAP form helps Kloudi understand the users tooling, workflow and data flow points between tools. Post analysis of the parameters from the form, the user is on-boarded. On-boarding includes a detailed online walkthrough of the platform and helping the user extension and configure their tools. During the on-boarding the user installs VSCode extension in-case he/she hasn't installed the ext yet. Post on-boarding User is ready to use Kloudi with usage and features remaining constant across the Web-app and VSCode ext.

VSCode ext usage can be triggered by **Command+K** in Mac systems or **Ctrl+K** in Linux or Windows systems. Rest of the usability instructions and views remain the same over both webapp and within the IDE.


## Connect Tools
Post on-boarding the user can integrate the tools they use for their issue resolution workflow monitoring and management.

This can be activated by viewing simple suggestions as triggered by the EAP forms recordings and can be activated by simple API key integration path initiation.

The integrations are viewed as simple cards and triggered towards initiation basis simple authentication key based log-in.

Data viewed and used by Kloudi is only the triggers rendered by these tools, In-app code is not stored in any form by Kloudi.

## Converse

The Kloudi interface is search driven for any data to be viewed or action to be taken. The search can be initiated for anything like ;

- Viewing data of existing tool e.g: Show me my active integrations.
- Viewing data triggers thrown by an existing tool e.g: Show me my datadog logs in the past 24 hrs
- Collated and analysed view of data aggregated across tools e.g: Show me errors in the past 48hrs
- Actions to be taken on aggregated data view e.g: Open a single issue in Jira for all similar bugs.
- Viewing errors by type e.g; Show me all 404 errors in the past 1 hr.

## Algorithmic functionality

Kloudi is currently trained to work on queries addressed as natural language based triggers in the the universe of the tools that it operates in.

Every action of a single tool is automatically exposed to the user as a natural language based query post integration. While any new tool not pre-existing in the list of available integrations in Kloudi's current form can be requested for through a request trigger sent to us. Functionality, training of Kloudi and exposure of requested integrations and related actions can be provided within 4hrs of acceptance of request.

In terms of Kloudi's ability to understand intents, currently it not only understands simple reciprocation of data like show me errors in past 24hrs but also is trained to perform cross-functionality.

Kloudi can basis trigger identify exact issue and similar or dummy issues triggered by the parent issue that needs to be fixed.

The Similar issues can be viewed upon performing a search query.

## Error data coverage

Currently the following enriched data snippet can be viewed by user to aid decision making and action.

- Stack-trace of error.
- Log leading upto error
- The number of parallel triggers the error caused or occurence frequency
- Primal cause or root cause of error needing to be fixed.
- Similar issues or errors triggered by the primary issue and leading to fraternal issues
- Redirection to home window of any specific tool triggering any one of the errors.
- Error distinction and data by type of error triggered.
- Suggestive actions wrto the triggered error

## Derivative actions

Actions are derivative results of the mental models that are now embedded and performed by Kloudi's data aggregation and viewing engine. Since the workflow is issue management the actions related to the workflow that each persona would like to perform post viewing causal error can be as follows.

- Developers would like to close errors across their tools or mark tool notifications as viewed after identifying causal error.
- Developers would like to check validity of similar bugs.
- Developers would like to perform bureaucratic actions on project management tools with relation to tracking and maintaining history of error.
- Developers would like the options to create either split issues or single issues of the error and related/similar errors that occured.
- QA would like to assign the error fix to dev to whom the code belongs.
- QA would like to view updated status of errors occured.
- EM would like to view statuses of errors occurring and fixed
- EM would like to view generic error data.

The actions above are capabilities that are incorporated in Kloudi and can be viewed as either suggestions post data aggregation or can be initiated via the search feature.


# Getting Started
Kloudi began its journey into existence as a small experiment with a select few users. From there it has moved to becoming a full fledged product with users being queued up in an [Early Access Program \(EAP\)](https://kloudi.tech/signup 'Kloudi Signup for Early Access Program'). 

> Click here to learn more about why we have an Early Access Program.

Sign yourself up for the EAP, [install](vscode:extension/Kloudi.kloudi ') the VSCode extension and you are good to go.


# What is Kloudi best at?
## Workflow Focus

Currently Kloudi is focussed to optimise the issue resolution workflow. Which means the following persona's can best benefit from using Kloudi.

- Developer
- QA
- Engineering Manager.

We are aiming to reduce debugging time through optimising debugging and converting mental models performed on tool data into actual actionable data

## Best Use Case

We recommend Kloudi to be used to perform any debugging related action or queries or to connect data pointers across tools to give you actionable data. The VSCode extension is best suited for developers and QA's, while engineering managers may choose to use the webapp due to minimal IDE usage suiting their workflow interations.

Ideally suited for teams using 4 or more tools from the following categories for debugging data.

1. Error Management
2. Log Management
3. Code Management
4. Project Management.

Tools available for immediate extension can be integrated post access being granted for sign-in.

Ideally Kloudi is aimed at performing real time debugging. Kloudi ensures assistance and accuracy in reporting of the root cause issue to be fixed, historic data and logs of occurrence of issues and subsequent triggers and counter measures which are translated into one click actions that can be taken to fix the occurred issue.


# Feedback

Since the current workflow focus of Kloudi encompasses tools that are used for issue management there might be integrations of tools unavailable for immediate extension. In case you are using a tool that is not currently available for you to extension you can request us for having it enabled with all related actions exposed.

If Kloudi has mis-identified your query intent or if certain minor features seem missing and you need them added, we can be notified about that too.

Kloudi is a platform that will grow and get better with your usage and we have ensured that feature requests or feedbacks are received from within the product's design.

You may also rate the accuracy of the data and actions suggested by Kloudi and we will ensure that the Kloudi's algorithm's are trained better to understand your workflow and intents.

# What to expect in future releases

We want to expand Kloudi's availability in the IDE for a developers entire universe of devtools and workflows. While we are taking a workflow by workflow approach we encourage you sharing things you want to see Kloudi do.

In the near future these are the few features within the current workflow you can expect to see in subsequent releases.

- Suggesting code fixes which would mean not just suggesting actions to be taken but also code snippets which would be solutions for the error faced.
- Collaborative feature would ensure that users share actions and data intents that they usually track and can now have their team track as well.
- EM's ability to view PR and judge for their teams's efficacy thus plan releases better.
- Encompassing more workflows and related tools in the developer universe.
- Improved data co-relation and output.
- Better Natural language to intent mapping.

## Get Early Access Now.
